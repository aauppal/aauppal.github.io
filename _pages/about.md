Dr. Ali Arshad Uppal received his PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (Control Systems) from COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), Islamabad, Pakistan in 2016. During his Ph.D., from 2015—2016, he worked as a visiting scholar at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. From 2020—2021, he also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. He is currently working as a Tenured Associate Professor at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, CUI. His research interests include nonlinear control/estimation, sliding mode control, process control, optimal control, data driven control, and control of infinite-dimensional systems. He has mainly applied his research skills to the energy conversion systems: underground coal gasification (UCG) process, airborne wind energy system (AWES), surface coal gasifiers, drum boiler turbine system and fuel cell system. So far, he has authored/co-authored more than 30 research papers in peer reviewed journals and international conferences. Some of his work has been published in top ranked journals of control systems and energy, which include IEEE control systems technology, journal of process control, international journal of controls, journal of the Franklin institute and Energy. He has also served as a reviewer for various journals and conferences related to control systems. Moreover, he has managed a special issue: sliding mode control in dynamic system, MDPI Electronics ([https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/Sliding_Mode_Control_in_Dynamic_Systems)) as a guest editor. He has been elected to the grade of senior member, IEEE as a recognition of his research contributions in the area of control systems in June 2022.
