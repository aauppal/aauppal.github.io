Dr. Ali Arshad Uppal received his PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (Control Systems) from [COMSATS University Islamabad](https://www.comsats.edu.pk/contactus.aspx) (CUI), Islamabad, Pakistan in 2016. During his Ph.D., from 2015—2016, he worked as a visiting scholar at the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.osu.edu/), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. From 2020—2021, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Faculty of Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.inicial), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. He is currently working as a Tenured Associate Professor at the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering, CUI](http://ww2.comsats.edu.pk/faculty/FacultyDetails.aspx?Uid=22118). He has been elected to the grade of [Senior Member, IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) as a recognition of his research contributions in the field of control systems in June 2022.

His research interests include nonlinear control/estimation, sliding mode control, process control, optimal control, data driven control, and control of infinite-dimensional systems. He has mainly applied his research skills to the energy conversion systems: underground coal gasification (UCG) process, airborne wind energy system (AWES), surface coal gasifiers, drum boiler turbine system and fuel cell system. He is currently working on the modeling and control of active cell balanicng of Lithium-ion batteries to extend the range of electric vehicles. So far, he has authored/co-authored 34 research papers in peer reviewed journals and international conferences. Moreover, he has managed a special issue: [Sliding Mode Control in Dynamic Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/Sliding_Mode_Control_in_Dynamic_Systems), MDPI Electronics, as a guest editor.
