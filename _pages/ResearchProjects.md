# 1. Current Research Topics
## 1.1. Learning-Based Predictive Control for Active Cell Balancing in Electrified Vehicles for Range Extension

### 1.1.1. Background
The electric vehicle (EV) market is steadily growing, with projections indicating over 672 million EVs on the roads by 2050. The battery pack, primarily lithium-ion, serves as the core of an EV, influencing its range. Cell imbalance, a key factor limiting EV range, can lead to battery pack shutdown based on a single cell’s condition. Active cell balancing (ACB) emerges as a crucial solution to counter cell imbalance, enhancing overall battery pack performance, safety, and consequently, EV range.

### 1.1.2. Proposed Research
EV battery packs are equipped with a battery management system (BMS), responsible for monitoring and control. The cell equalization circuit, a pivotal BMS component, plays a vital role. This research aims to extend EV range through state-of-charge (SoC)-based ACB, with objectives including:
1. Selecting an appropriate ACB network (ACBN)
2. Developing a mathematical model for a cell, considering SoC, thermal dynamics, and terminal voltage
3. Detailed mathematical modeling of ACBN, encompassing cell dynamics, balancing currents, and power losses
4. Designing a range-maximizing, robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) using the ACBN model
5. Conducting a simulation study to showcase NMPC performance and EV range extension
6. Developing a prototype for real-time implementation.
The choice of the lithium-ion cell’s mathematical model is critical. Empirical models are simple but lack
electrochemical insight, while physics-informed models are accurate but computationally complex. Utilizing
specially designed excitation signals, experimental data can be employed to develop a data-driven model for
the ACBN, achieving a compromise between accuracy and computational cost.

### 1.1.3. Intellectual Merit
Despite extensive research in ACB control, certain avenues require exploration. Research gaps include:
* Often overlooked high-fidelity modeling of balancing currents and power losses, crucial for assessing ACBN efficiency
* The subjective choice of a cell dynamics model, necessitating alignment with both ACB (local) and EV range extension (global) paradigms
* the nascent stage of research on range extension-aware NMPC, demanding further development.
  
### 1.1.4. Broader Impact
The control system’s design for EV battery packs extends beyond immediate applications, offering broader impacts such as:
* Advancing scientific knowledge by combining data-driven and model-based methods to understand and control battery systems, capturing their complex dynamics.
* Enhancing EV industry innovation and competitiveness through a novel technique optimizing battery performance and safety under diverse conditions.
* Improving environmental and social benefits of EVs by reducing emissions, energy consumption, and
battery degradation, while increasing driving range, reliability, and affordability
